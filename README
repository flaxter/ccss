Instructions:

python example-streams.py --tracts "[8430.0, 8431.0, 8432.0, 8433.0, 8434.0, 8435.0, 8436.0, 8437.0, 8438.0]"
python example-streams.py "pot hole in street" --area "[6]"

python example-locations.py --area "[34,35]" 
python example-locations.py --predict vacant


This one will take a long time to run; while it's running you can check
the results by opening another terminal and looking at results/vacant.csv 
(the -u option for python tells it to write results right away without 
waiting until the program exits.)

python -u example-simultaneous.py --predict vacant --output results/vacant.csv
